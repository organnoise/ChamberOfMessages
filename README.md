# Concourse of Messages
This project requires a raspberry pi running ChucK to enable wireless-OSC communication between the clothes-pin collection and the main Max patch. 

## Arduino
Uses conductive clothes pins as buttons to trigger serial-info, which is then translated to OSC messages.

## ChucK
Translates serial messages from Arduino into OSC to be sent to Max patch.

## Max
Run the Max patch on computer with capable graphics card. Source videos not included due to their size.
